### Advancements

- [Make-A-Video](https://makeavideo.studio/) by Meta AI, is an AI system that generates high-quality video clips from text prompts. It leverages recent advancements in text-to-image generation technology and utilizes publicly available datasets for transparency, it empowers users to create content easily and can create videos from images or remix existing ones. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792">(paper)</a> 

- [Emu Video](https://emu-video.metademolab.com/) and [Emu Edit](https://emu-edit.metademolab.com/) by Meta AI. Emu Video uses diffusion models to create high-quality videos from text prompts, outperforming previous methods in human evaluations. Meanwhile, Emu Edit is a versatile picture editing tool allowing detailed instructions for tasks like local/global edits, background manipulation, color/geometry transformations, detection, and segmentation. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/">(blog)</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10709">(Emu Video paper)</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://emu-edit.metademolab.com/assets/emu_edit.pdf">(Emu Edit paper)</a>

### Article & Papers

- [Imagen Video: High Definition Video Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02303) (2022) by Google, is a paper introducing a high-definition video generation method using diffusion models. The technique, based on sequential noise addition to latent representations, achieves top results in video synthesis benchmarks. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://imagen.research.google/video/">(website)</a>
