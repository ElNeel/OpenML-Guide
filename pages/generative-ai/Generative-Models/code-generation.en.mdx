### Advancements

- [AlphaDev](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms/): DeepMind's AlphaDev introduces faster sorting algorithms integrated into C++, boosting speed by up to 70% for shorter sequences and 1.7% for longer ones exceeding 250k elements. These algorithms can revolutionize various computing tasks, affecting everything from online search result ranking to data processing on devices.


### Papers

- [Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304) (2023): STOP is an innovative code generation method that iteratively enhances itself. It begins with an initial "improver" program that uses a language model to boost solutions for different tasks. STOP refines this improver, generating significantly better code. While it's not fully Recursively Self-Improving, it demonstrates the potential of modern language models for efficient self-improvement in code generation.
